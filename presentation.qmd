# thoughts
- epidemiology is making head room
- causal inference (anderson-rubin tradition) and time series don't talk to each other
- dpdm

# significance

- part of the causal revolution-revolution: calloway & santana, rainfall issues

# misspecified model
- does not recover parameters

# note
- no new instruments necessary

# minimum T necessary
